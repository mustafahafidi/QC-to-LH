### Semi-automatic QuickCheck to LiquidHaskell migration

This project aims to facilitate the migration/conversion of QuickCheck properties to LiquidHaskell proofs, by automating the translation process of QuickCheck tests to LiquidHaskell formal proof obligations.

### Usage (dev)

- Install `LiquidHaskell` and if you want it to run on file change, install `spy`.
- In `package.json` are provided some commands that run liquidhaskell with `stack` which you can either copy paste in your terminal, or run using `yarn` or `npm`
